##  Overview

This project is a modular, event-driven backtesting framework written in Python. It is designed to simulate trading strategies against historical or generated market data to evaluate their performance. The framework is built with a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to introduce new strategies, data sources, or performance metrics. At its core, it provides a simulation engine that processes market ticks, executes trades based on strategy signals, and tracks the portfolio's equity over time.

##  Features
1. Event-Driven Architecture: The core engine processes market data tick-by-tick, simulating a live trading environment.
2. Modular Design: Components for data handling, strategy logic, execution, and reporting are separated, allowing for easy modification and extension.
3. Extensible Strategy Interface: Includes a base Strategy class and two sample implementations: Moving Average Crossover (MAC) and Momentum.
4. Data Simulation: A data generator is included to create realistic, customizable market data using a Gaussian random walk.
5. Realistic Trade Execution: The engine simulates order processing and includes a configurable failure rate to mimic real-world execution uncertainty.
6. Performance Analytics: Automatically calculates key metrics like Total Return, Sharpe Ratio (per-tick), and Maximum Drawdown.
7. Automated Reporting: Generates a clean, readable performance summary in a Markdown file (performance_report.md), complete with an ASCII art equity curve.

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

Before getting started with FINM32500-HW1, ensure your runtime environment meets the following requirements:

    Programming Language: Python 3.x (No external libraries are required).

###  Installation (Build from source)

Clone the FINM32500-HW1 repository:

	git clone [https://github.com/Lauristt/FINM32500-HW1](https://github.com/Lauristt/FINM32500-HW1)

Navigate to the project directory:

	cd FINM32500-HW1

No further installation is needed as the project only uses standard Python libraries.

###  Usage
To run the simulation on Linux Server, follow these steps:

Generate Market Data:First, run the data generator script to create the market_data.csv file.

    python data_generator.py

Run the Backtest: Execute the main script to run the backtest with the chosen strategy (configurable in main.py).

    python main.py

View Results: After the simulation finishes, a performance_report.md file will be created in the project directory. Open this file to view the results.
